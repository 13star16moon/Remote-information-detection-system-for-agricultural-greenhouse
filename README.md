# Remote-information-detection-system-for-agricultural-greenhouse
Through the analog-to-digital conversion and communication protocol of STM32 single chip microcomputer, the communication with the sensor is established to obtain the environmental information such as temperature, humidity, light, water level and soil dryness. Through the standard input and output port of STM32 single chip microcomputer, the high and low levels are output to control the breaking of the relay, so as to control the irrigation and light of agricultural greenhouse. Establish communication with esp8266 through the serial port communication of STM32, so that the single chip microcomputer can access the Internet and connect with the cloud platform of the Internet of things.
